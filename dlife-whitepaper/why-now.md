# Why Now: A Converging Opportunity for Life Sciences + Web3

Several powerful trends are converging to make this the perfect moment to build dLife — a decentralized, human-centric infrastructure for the future of life sciences and health.

* 🔬 Growing Adoption of Consumer Genomics
Over 40 million people worldwide have taken consumer DNA tests, creating an unprecedented base of individuals who are familiar with genetic data and motivated to learn more. At the same time, advanced multi-omics tests — including methylation, microbiome, and proteomics — are becoming more affordable and accessible, expanding the landscape of personal life science data.

* 🔐 Rising Demand for Data Ownership and Privacy
As headlines continue to expose misuse of genetic data by centralized companies, users are increasingly aware of the risks and demanding greater control. The traditional “test and forget” model is giving way to a new mindset: data is an asset, and individuals should own it.

* 🌐 Maturing Web3 Ecosystem and DeSci Movement
Web3 is no longer just about speculation. The DeSci movement is bringing researchers, builders, and funders together to create decentralized alternatives to traditional scientific institutions. At the same time, there is a strong and growing interest in real-world assets on-chain — including health data, longevity metrics, and biological uniqueness.
