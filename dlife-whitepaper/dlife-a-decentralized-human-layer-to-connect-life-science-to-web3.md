# dLife: A Decentralized Human-Layer to Connect Life Science to Web3

The challenges in both life sciences and Web3 point to a fundamental disconnect: biological data lacks infrastructure for secure, open, and user-centric collaboration — while Web3 lacks trusted, verified, real-world human data to unlock its transformative potential.

*dLife bridges this gap.*

It serves as a decentralized human-layer protocol that empowers individuals to generate, own, and share their multi-omics and health data — with privacy, sovereignty, and incentives built-in. By aligning the incentives of users, researchers, and developers, dLife provides the missing trust and data infrastructure for decentralized science (DeSci), longevity research, and health innovation.

With dLife, individuals are no longer passive subjects of research or one-time users of sequencing services. They become active participants in a new ecosystem — one where they control their data, contribute to science, and benefit from the value it creates.
