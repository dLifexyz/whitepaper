# Products and Services

dLife offers a suite of products that together form the foundational infrastructure for user-centric life science data in the Web3 era. These products enable secure data generation, decentralized identity, and seamless integration with decentralized applications.

* üß¨ lifePass

*Genome-based, privacy-preserving Proof-of-Human DID*

lifePass is a decentralized identity (DID) solution powered by your unique genomic signature. It enables individuals to prove their humanity and biological uniqueness on-chain ‚Äî without exposing raw genetic data. lifePass is the trust layer for Web3 applications that require verified, real-world users.

* üõ†Ô∏è dLife SDK & APIs

*Make DNA a programmable asset*

The dLife SDK and APIs allow developers to integrate decentralized bio-data into their applications. From querying permissioned omics profiles to verifying lifePass identities, developers can build rich, biology-aware dApps for DeSci, longevity, and personalized health use cases.

* üì¶ dLife Omics Testing Kits

*Genome, Epigenome, and other multi-omics testing kits*

These testing kits serve as the physical gateway into the dLife ecosystem. Users who take dLife-certified tests receive their omics data in a secure, encrypted format ‚Äî and unlock access to airdrops, gated dApps, and data monetization opportunities. Each kit is a portal to identity, ownership, and participation in decentralized life science.
