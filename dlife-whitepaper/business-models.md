# Business Models

dLife is designed with a sustainable, multi-revenue stream model that aligns user incentives with network growth. Our core monetization strategies include:

* 🧾 Life ID Minting Fees & Staking

Users minting their genome-based lifePass IDs pay a small minting fee, which supports the network and validators. In the future, staking mechanisms may be introduced to secure on-chain identity proofs and incentivize responsible data management.

* 💎 Premium dLife Omics Testing Kits

While core functionality can work with third-party tests, dLife-branded omics testing kits — including genome, epigenome, and microbiome — offer higher-quality data and native integration into the dLife ecosystem. These kits follow pricing models that support both one-time and subscription-based revenue.

* 🔁 Bio-Asset Marketplace & Transactions

dLife enables a peer-to-peer marketplace where users can choose to license or contribute their encrypted omics data to research DAOs, longevity protocols, or pharma partners — with dLife earning protocol fees on data transactions.

*🤝 Partnership Integrations & Licensing

dLife offers SDK/API access, integration packages, and white-label solutions for biotech companies, health apps, DeSci platforms, and research institutions — generating revenue through licensing and usage-based fees.
