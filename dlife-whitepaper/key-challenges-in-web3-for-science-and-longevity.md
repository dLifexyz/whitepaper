# Key Challenges in Web3 for Science and Longevity

While Web3 technologies promise decentralization, ownership, and incentive innovation, the current ecosystem faces fundamental limitations that hinder their application to real-world scientific and health problems.

* Scarcity of Meaningful, Real-World Data On-Chain

Most blockchain activity today revolves around financial transactions and digital assets, with limited integration of high-quality, structured real-world datasets — particularly in health, biology, and multi-omics domains. This gap severely limits the potential of decentralized science (DeSci) and longevity-focused applications.

* Lack of Robust Proof-of-Human and Identity Systems

Web3 remains dominated by anonymous or pseudonymous actors, making it difficult to establish scientific credibility, data provenance, or regulatory compliance. For research involving biological or clinical data, mechanisms that can verify human identity and consent — while preserving privacy — are essential but still underdeveloped.

* Insufficient Real-World Utility in DeSci and Longevity Projects

Many DeSci and longevity initiatives are still in experimental or narrative phases, with few products delivering tangible value to users, researchers, or institutions. Token incentives often outpace product readiness, leading to hype cycles rather than lasting adoption or impact.
