# How dLife Works: Unlocking the Value of Human Biology in Web3

dLife is building the first open-bio infrastructure that puts individuals — not institutions — at the center of genomic and multi-omics data ownership. It is designed to transform fragmented biological data systems into a decentralized, user-centric network.

Core Functions and Innovations:

* DNA as Identity:

dLife introduces the concept of DNA as a digital identity layer. Through secure encoding and cryptographic hashing, users can verify their biological uniqueness without revealing sensitive raw data — enabling Proof-of-Human without compromising privacy.

* Genetic Data as a Decentralized Asset:

By tokenizing and encrypting individual omics data, dLife turns static reports into dynamic, composable assets that users can store, share, and use across decentralized applications — all while maintaining full control.

* User Sovereignty and Incentives:

With dLife, individuals can not only manage access to their data, but also choose to contribute to scientific research or DAO-based health initiatives in exchange for rewards — unlocking a new value cycle around data utility and ethical monetization.

* Bridge Between Biotech and Web3:

dLife provides the trust, infrastructure, and interoperability layer that biotech and Web3 have both been missing. It enables researchers to access verified, user-consented multi-omics datasets, while allowing Web3 developers to build meaningful, human-linked applications in DeSci, longevity, and beyond.
