# dLife Whitepaper

dLife is dedicated to build a Decentralized Human Layer to connect life science to Web3.

## 1. Key Challenges in Life Sciences Today

The life sciences sector is undergoing rapid technological advancement, yet it faces structural challenges that limit its full potential — especially in the context of multi-omics data and precision health.

### Low Public Participation in Genomic and Multi-Omics Testing

Although the cost of sequencing has dropped dramatically, public engagement remains low. The general population lacks awareness of how genomic and multi-omics insights can benefit their health. Even among those who participate, there is limited understanding or utilization of their data, leading to weak user retention and low data activation rates.

### Fragmented Data and Persistent Privacy Concerns

Multi-omics data — spanning genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and beyond — are often fragmented across isolated silos, whether in academic institutions, hospitals, or private companies. This fragmentation severely hampers data integration and research reproducibility. At the same time, users have little transparency or control over how their biological data is stored, shared, or used, further eroding trust.

### Outdated and Unsustainable Business Models

Many current business models in life sciences are either extractive (e.g., selling kits without long-term user value) or overly reliant on centralized platforms and one-off transactions. Such models fail to incentivize ongoing data contribution, collaborative research, or ecosystem growth — making them difficult to scale or sustain in the long run.

## 2. Key Challenges in Web3 for Science and Longevity
While Web3 technologies promise decentralization, ownership, and incentive innovation, the current ecosystem faces fundamental limitations that hinder their application to real-world scientific and health problems.

### Scarcity of Meaningful, Real-World Data On-Chain
Most blockchain activity today revolves around financial transactions and digital assets, with limited integration of high-quality, structured real-world datasets — particularly in health, biology, and multi-omics domains. This gap severely limits the potential of decentralized science (DeSci) and longevity-focused applications.

### Lack of Robust Proof-of-Human and Identity Systems
Web3 remains dominated by anonymous or pseudonymous actors, making it difficult to establish scientific credibility, data provenance, or regulatory compliance. For research involving biological or clinical data, mechanisms that can verify human identity and consent — while preserving privacy — are essential but still underdeveloped.

### Insufficient Real-World Utility in DeSci and Longevity Projects
Many DeSci and longevity initiatives are still in experimental or narrative phases, with few products delivering tangible value to users, researchers, or institutions. Token incentives often outpace product readiness, leading to hype cycles rather than lasting adoption or impact.
