# Bloodline Protocol

A Genome-based Digital Assets Distributing Protocol Powered by LifePass

## Overview
Bloodline Protocol is a novel on-chain protocol designed to distribute digital assets based on individuals’ genomic information. By leveraging LifePass as a cryptographically secure and privacy-preserving genomic identity layer, the protocol introduces an entirely new paradigm of digital asset inheritance, identity grouping, and community governance rooted in biological relationships.

## Protocol Structure
1. First Phase: Genomic Tagging Layer
This phase uses selected genomic features to assign tags or attributes to individuals, enabling eligibility gating and distribution logic based on:

* Qualitative Genomic Traits

Example: APOE genotypes for longevity-related distributions

Example: Lactase persistence (e.g., LCT variants) for dietary-related assets

* Quantitative Genomic Traits

Example: Ancestry Composition (e.g., 67% East Asian, 15% European)

Application: Distribution of assets tied to geographic/cultural heritage

2. Second Phase: Kinship Computation Layer
This phase calculates and verifies on-chain N-degree biological relationships via LifePass proofs, enabling rules based on:

* Parent-Child Relationships

Enable inheritance-like asset transfer with verified biological links

* Extended Kinship (2nd-5th degree)

Forming decentralized family groups or clans

Asset distribution tied to family size, lineage, or shared ancestors

## Applications
1. Digital Legacy
Biologically-Gated Inheritance Protocol
Transfer NFTs, tokens, or vault access to verifiable biological descendants
(e.g., “only my biological children can claim this digital inheritance”)

Living Will on Chain
Smart contracts enforce rules such as:

"Split my estate among my descendants with ≥25% shared ancestry and APOE-e2 genotype."

2. Digital Ethnic Community Building
On-chain Ethnic Identity Anchoring
Form DAOs or social groups based on ancestry composition verified through LifePass

Community-Gated Asset Airdrops
Example:

An airdrop for users with ≥30% Native American ancestry verified on-chain

Cultural Preservation DAOs
Individuals sharing a common genetic heritage can pool resources to fund heritage projects (e.g., language preservation, rituals, history archives)

## Integration with Web3
* ZK-Proofs for Privacy
All genomic data is processed through zero-knowledge proof systems to avoid revealing raw DNA data on-chain.

* Programmable Genomic Contracts
Smart contracts can reference genomic tags or kinship proofs in logic gates for access control, voting rights, or asset distribution.

## Future Directions
* Biological Network Mapping
Build the world’s first programmable, privacy-preserving global bloodline graph

* Genealogy-Based Governance
Voting power or representation weighted by verified biological ties or ancestral lines

* Bio-DID Integration
Expand digital identity beyond wallet addresses into verifiable biological lineage
