# dLife Personal Omics Tests

dLife is collaborating with trusted service providers to offer personal multi-omics testing, helping users join and engage with the dLife ecosystem.

Currently, dLife and its partners provide [personal genome](dlife-genome-test.md) and [epigenome tests](dlife-epigenome-test.md). In the near future, dLife plans to expand its testing services to include blood tests, metabolome tests, and more.

dLife offers a comprehensive solution to empower DeSci and Longevity projects by integrating personal omics testing into their products and services. With our globally distributed life science infrastructure, we support every step of the process — from supply chain management and medical device regulations, to sequencing services, bioinformatics analysis, and on-chain protocols that securely link data and test results to your customers’ wallets.
